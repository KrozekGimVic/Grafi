# Grafi

Learning graph algorithms.

## Instalation and running tests
Run
```
git clone git@github.com:KrozekGimVic/Grafi.git
```
Go to root folder of the repository and do the usual compile & run cycle:
```
mkdir -p build
cd build
cmake ..
make
../bin/tests
```
If all tests appear green, you are good to go.

## Documentation
To generate documentation, go to `build/` and run
```
make docs
```
You need to have doxygen installed.

# Full test
Before each commit, please run `./full_test.sh` and make sure it completes without errors.
Only than can you commit. You can add it to your pre-commit hook.

Use `./full_test.sh --help` for usage instructions. Example run:
```
$ ./full_test.sh
